## About me

I'm a web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. After the Covid-19's pandemic, I learned to code because I wanted to change the path I was going through. I started with the course "Argentina Programa" offered by the government. As a kid, I learned some BASIC on my Spectrum clone, but I couldnt say I knew how to write code. Last year, I was doing some free courses or following youtube tutorials side by side but I think I really learned to code thanks to the FreeCodeCamp's Javascript course. And I love it!. Later, I learn Angular and Java with Spring, but I didnt wanted to marry with a stack, so I learned Vue by myself. Now, I am learning some Data Science and Python in the Oracle Next Education course.

Some days I like the backend side more. Some days I like frontend side more. For that, I think in myself as a fullstack developer. I like web development but I want to learn about software beyond the web. I'm intrigued about machine learning and IA (because I'm a huge sci-fi nerd), but I would love to learn C# or C++ to work as a game developer too. For now, I want to get my first forma job as a developer. 

I'm a big tech lover since I was a child. Although my first contact with a computer was with a ZX Spectrum clone, my first presonal computer was a 386DX 40mhz with just 1MB of RAM and a modest 40MB hard drive. One of the first things I did with my PC was erase all the boot files and I learned how to install MS-DOS 6.22. I'm the family member you call if your PC isnt working. Later, on my twenties, I installed GNU/Linux for the first time. And I love all about it.
