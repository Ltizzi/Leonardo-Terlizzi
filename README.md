## About me

  I'm a web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. After the Covid-19's pandemic, I learned to code because I wanted to change the path I was going through. I started with the course "Argentina Programa" offered by the government. As a kid, I learned some BASIC on my Spectrum clone, but I couldnt say I knew how to write code. Last year, I was doing some free courses or following youtube tutorials side by side but I think I really learned to code thanks to the FreeCodeCamp's Javascript course. And I love it!. Later, I learned Angular and Java with Spring. Then I learned Vue and NodeJs/Express by myself. Now, I am taking a course about IA and machine learning (with all Data Science and Python/Pandas/Seaborn basics). I love to experiment with Stable Difussion and I want to learn more about the posibilities with the IA.

  Some days I like the backend side more. Sometimes I like the frontend side more. That's why I think in myself as a fullstack developer. I like web development but I want to learn about software beyond the web. I love to learn new things and I always looking for the next thing to learn. I'm actually working in a personal project (a social network about memes, like a twitter clone without text, only memes). Mostly, I'm doing it for the practice and learning experience. 

   I'm a big tech lover since I was a child. Although my first contact with a computer was with a ZX Spectrum clone, my first personal computer was a 386DX 40mhz with just 1MB of RAM and a modest 40MB hard drive. One of the first things I did with my PC was erase all the boot files and I fix it by myself. Then I learned how to install MS-DOS 6.22. I lived the transition from CLI operation systems to operation system with GUI. My history with the Internet is a story about love at first sight. I learned all about the different network protocols (http, ftp, smtp, irc, etc), I learned the basics about Web design. Later, on my twenties, I installed GNU/Linux for the first time and I love all about it. I'm the family member or friend you call if your PC isnt working.
